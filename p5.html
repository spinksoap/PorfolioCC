        Design Process

      <p>
        The beginning of my dsgin process started off with me looking up some of my haitian culture's pattern in fashion. I  thought I would find something interesting especially as far as color pallettes and create a different pattern from that. When I googled "haitian patterns" I found this: 
        <img src=https://cdn.glitch.me/2be9316e-cee2-4d75-8cf9-b07620779812%2Fscreenshot.png?v=1633644307587> Out of that I created this designed this print: <img src= https://cdn.glitch.me/2be9316e-cee2-4d75-8cf9-b07620779812%2FUntitled_Artwork%204.jpg?v=1633644696789> 
        I used the symmetry tool in quadrant form the colors were inspired the google search. The intention I had designing was that I would replicate this in line form and the animation would come from taking one of teh 45 degree angled lines moving across therows fo lines giving the illusion that the entire row of lines would move. In constructing 
        my for loops I encountered many problems mainly because of the power (or lack there of) of my computer system. I ended up continuously deleting numbers, changing ratios, unwilllingly because my computer would litterally freeze at even the smallest number of loops and sizes. While I was changing numbers, I ended up with a cross hatch- like pattern that caught my eye ( in combination with rotate() function. I had already applied a similar beige color that was a few shades darker and thought- “wow that kinda looks like straw”. So , I scrapped my origianl idea for a made up pattern for this starw pattern that  I would color to symbolize the haitian straw hat. I started off by making one nested for loop. This gave me my pattern but no animation. Then I used the  rectangle as the action for the for loop to perform. Inside of the rectatngle I tried to use the variables I created in the loop as values for my x and y. (If I understand correctly, I didn’t have to use my variables as values for the for loop because those were just to give direction for the loop in general). The created  interesting patterns that were still straw like but the proportions of when and where they would start and stop weren’t right. While experimenting with pluging in different numbers I random lyinserted mouseX  and mouseY (because they make anything look cool and found this could be where my illlusive aspect could come from.

        Reflection

      <p>
        I liked this project very much but it taught me that I need to be aware of the tools that I’m using and how well they are even capable of taking on the task I’d need them to perform. (Coding itself is that way too because the logic aspect forces you to think in baby steps and would initially make you feel you have lmited understanding by how basic the original tools are – but you learn to think  outside of the box). But as far as my computer performing loops, I actually cried at how it would continuously freeze and overreact to any number input in any loop but especially for loops. When I tried nested for loops all the fans would turn on and I would smell my laptop barbequing. I was finally understanding sequence and logic but the way the my laptop would react made me question if I  knew the make up of a loop properly, I rewatched tutorials and referred to other video material and tried to put the smallest basic numbers and the computer would still overreact. I thought “no way it’s me, it has to be the computer”. After googling why the computer would do this, I found people talking about accidentally making infinite loops. I still don’t know if I actually did that so here’s some screenshots:

        But I don’t think I did from what I understand about loops. // I went to the computer lab and put in my loops and they were fine. The computer still did freeze when I would put more thatn one nested loop in my sketch though. This experience has made me think of all of the times I’ve coded though- did I not unerstand enough of the language to build things (beside the syntax errors I would get) or could my computer just not handle it?
