        Design Process 
      </h1>
      <p>
      Over each 
Recalling my optical illusion assignemnt, I desided to reuse the rotate function again. I know it can  draw in a circular-like pattern   
      so tried iton this. I wanted to give halo like affect around the face but have that pattern be around the head and give an effect like 
      there were masks or shadows of faces. As far as my codes design, I leanred from the previous assignment how to organize my code by taking advantage of funcitons. But I felt I couldn't do that here since som much of my code was dependant on each other. </p>

        Reflection 
      
      </h1>
      <p>
        The concept andcoding forthis gaem was quite simple. My computeroculd not hadle any of the orignal ideas I wanted to perform. Orignially 
        my concept was to create a face filter out of the points of the golden face ratio mask using Angelina Jolie's face (because it couldn't read the orginal mask confidently). It could've madea great statement. My computer woudln't let me get
        plotting point of both points. I settled for this design which aesthetically is not far off. Funnily, since my coding from the beginning of the semester has 
        shown to be a reflection of my actual,natural thinking and logic, this week wasan example the times, that I've felt I had something important to say butno opportunity to say it.
