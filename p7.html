The pixelated people, thoughts of the parents, and furniture were hand drawn by myself in Procreate. The "floor" of the scene and bat weapon are credited below. Together this helped me create the look of a home,
      representative of my own home (but not acurate of my own home). Those representing "my parents" are wearing boring colored clothing while mine contrasts this as an ode to how, in real life, I contrast my parents
        figuratively as far as our beleifs and physically (especially in the medium of fashion). The "thoughts" they have include a heart, ring, baby, graduation cap, and stethiscope to represent questions about relationships
        (platonic and romantic), thoughts of who and when to marry, bearing a child(ren) and when, forceful ideas of pursuing higher education and what major to follow, and strong preadorned intrest in what career to follow respectively. 
        I'm defineitely going to add more of these icons and have them be more specific and increase in intrusion of life later.

        This was mentally and physically challenging for me as a project but very satisfying in the end. I was met with trying mathmatics and an extensice number of lines of code. I thinki did well organizing. Again, with each project I've 
        imporved my logic
