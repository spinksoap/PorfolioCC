I created the alien in Porceate. <img src= https://cdn.glitch.com/2be9316e-cee2-4d75-8cf9-b07620779812%2F2C9C329E-6ADA-41CE-B204-0774C704B346%202.svg?v=1632838347765> It was just an amalgamtion of random shapes and proportions but still included "human- like" figures. I exchanged files with Nassiba and Chloe (Huian). Chloe's sketch included the attached with the following: "This is a very sexy bandit leader, although he looks very fierce, but his dream is to be a modelï¼ŒHe wondered why even though he was dressed like this, people still knew he was a bandit". Nassiba's sketch included the attached and the following: "Meet the DIDAJE, a non-human figure created with game objects like dice cube, dart, and Jenga blocks. Inspired by rock balancing; stacking on top of the other without any other support. Its head is made of a dice cube, the body part is made with dartboard, and the legs are from Jenga blocks. It likes to rotate its head 360 degrees." Lastly mine is an alien named Luwoe who is like a goddess of love where she is from. The conecept is that Luwoe has powers that shine throught from the initial start up of the sketch yet and Luwoe's body is revealed as you erase the body of the others. When you click her body reappears and not only is she the only one that appears but she and her lovely magic are not earse able... because aliens are forever: bandits and robots are not. </p>

This project I went into much better. I feel that since I've started this class, my logic has improved. Fo rhte most part, I had no problem with syntax of functions. If anything I was just confused about what ot actually do. Given the prompt, I did mix the figures but now that I've learned the creation of a function and the liberties it provides, what do I do next? I can't say this has been my favorite of the assignments because there wasn't way I thought I could blend these to make it more aesthetically pleasing but I did learn the process and layer well.     </p>
