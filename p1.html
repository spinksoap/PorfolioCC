        Using the description of Simran, I interpreted what object it is she's lost before using p5.js.

        I started off drawing airpods- planning many arcs. As I got close to completing the first earbud, I realized her headphones could be a completely different shape. The design process started with a sketch that is a literal interpretaion of something that would have two receivers. This led me to thte traditional,"over the ear" headphone shape I ended up with. To transfer the sketch to code I bocked out main shapes in the heaphones which were arc and ellipses. To reflect a headphone cord, I started of with a rectangle but graduated to a cruve for a more natural depiction.

         My partner Simran, included the following as her description:
        "It's am electronic device, it has two oval receivers. And one cord to connect it to other devices. It's white. It's flexible." I didn't notice until this project the many headphones and the parts that shape them are combinations of ovals. I first though tof AirPods because they are so popular and they are oval. But half way, I thought the ovalness is not the most obvious shape to describe the headphones. Rereading the description made me realize that these were not wireless so AirPods and Samsung EarBuds are not applicable. Also rereading the deescription made me pay attention to that fact that receivers was used. I finally arrived at the possiblity of it being traditional over-the-ear or on-ear headphone because that is most immediately recognizable as oval shaped. The most difficult part is having perspective of the canvas and the placement of the primitves. Also being able to understand the perspective of pixel points in large numbers was challenging.
