I first started with an idea that I wanted a dripping pipe. It was immediatly what knew I wanted to do. I skethed it out on paper but as always, the reality of my abilites vs what is in my head came to play. The concept was that there would be a pipe that drips by the second into a bucket that would accumulate by the minute and a background that changed every hour. I got rid of the bucket because I was narrow minded at the time and though I could only make it with lines and not be able to change the fill but now thinking I should've used quad ☹️.  What I ended up with is not too far from my original goal: I still have a pipe but the drip moves by the second (instead of falling completely by the second) into a puddle that accumulates by the minute on the sidewalk.

        For this project I thought that I could be confident at first in terms of the execution of the code. My background in coding and getting acclamated to this class's projects made me fell like could broaden my creativity with if and if/else statements since I'd used them so often before. Overall, my logic was actually much better, it didn't get as many errors as I usually do when I'm coding. Although I still am having problems understanding the map() function, the problem mostly lied in me getting the sketch do my main aim which was getting the drop from the pipe onto the sidewalk in one second. I know that functionis supposed to covert values into a different range but no matter where I would put my "drop" variable or change the  ranges in map, I couldn't get the drop to perform properly. The closest I got was using millisend() with 30000 into it, but it just made the drop fall once, out of frame, and not repeat in the scketch at all.  This is probably my favorite of the projects so far though.
