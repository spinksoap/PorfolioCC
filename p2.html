         I began with sketches of the above bottle. The concept was to have surprising expressions on the bottle as a face while also changing the entire body of the bottle. The sketch was made in Procreate via iPad and Apple pencile using mirroring to get exact imagery. When proceding to p5.js, I began by blocking off large sections of the drawing in oder from background to foreground. For reasons I cannot remember, I changed the concept from a bottle to a bowl of soup. Before laying down any shapes, I translated the concept into a Figma sketch. Figma helps me with building x and y coordination perspective. Next, variables for the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth were created. Lastly, I began plotting the figures onto the plane.

           Understanding how to organize my code was one of the most important parts of this project. It helps most with effeciency and work flow. Not organizing enough had caused me debugging issues, being able to find mistakes in general, and having my sketch be functional at all. The project ultimately challenged my capabilties by having me reach further than what I thought possible. I'm really not sure why I ended up changing the sketch to soup but I do know that the amount of layering and dimension help me build a stronger confidence in p5.js. Lastly, I had to think alot about perspective. Variables are easy to undersand. But the perspective I had before redoing my entire project was that variables are about being able to build an entire entity out of while they more about further breaking down code so ultimately, an ease can come about when coding.
